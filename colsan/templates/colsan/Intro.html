    <p>
This is an experiment in the decision making. You are participating in an
experiment where you will decide in a team jointly with <strong>{{Constants.A_group_size}}</strong> other participants.
</p>
<p>The members of your team will anonymously interact with members of another
 team which also consists of <strong>{{Constants.B_group_size}}</strong> persons.</p>
<p>
  Your payoff depends on your own decisions and the decisions of both your team
  and the other teamâ€™s decisions.

</p>
<p>
  We will describe the decision situation that you and other participants will
   have to make below. This decision situation will be repeated for <strong>{{Constants.num_rounds_first}}</strong> rounds.
      Then we will inform you how the experiment proceeds for extra <strong>{{Constants.num_rounds_second}}</strong>  rounds.
