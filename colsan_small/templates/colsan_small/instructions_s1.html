    <h2>The Task</h2>
    <p>
        Each participant is randomly assigned to a group of three.
        There are two groups: <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, with three participants
        in each group. </p>
    <p>We call a participant from the group A: <b>Participant A</b>,
        and a participant from the group B: <b>Participant B</b>.</p>
    <strong>You have been assigned to the group {{ player.subgroup }}.</strong> Your decisions will affect your
    own outcome, the outcomes of the other members
    of your group (<b>{{ player.subgroup }}</b>), and the outcomes of the members of another group
    (<b>{{ player.another_subgroup_name }}</b>). Likewise, the decisions of the other members
    of your group and of the other group will affect your outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment consists of <strong>{{ Constants.num_rounds }}</strong> rounds.
        In each round you have to take the following decision:
    </p>
    <h2>Decision:</h2>

    <p>You are given <b>{{ Constants.endowment }} points</b> and you have to decide how much, if any, to transfer to the other
        participant.

        The amount of money you decide to transfer will be multiplied by <b>{{ Constants.pd_factor }}</b> and earned by the
        other
        participant.

        The other participant will be given the same choice.</p>

    <p>
        For instance:
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you both transfer everything, you both get {{ max_pd }} points and are better off than you
            you both keep
            everything.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you transfer everything and the other person keeps everything, then you earn nothing
            in this stage.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you keep
            everything and the other participant transfers everything, then you get {{ egoistic_pd }} points and
            your partner will earn nothing.
        </li>
    </ul>

    </p>


    <p>
        Your partner from group {{ player.another_subgroup_name }}
        has the same incentives as you. You and your partner will make your decisions simultaneously.
    </p>
