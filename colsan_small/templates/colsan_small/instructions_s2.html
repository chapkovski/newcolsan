    <p>In Stage 2 you again have an endowment of {{ Constants.punishment_endowment }} points.</p>
    <p>
        In this stage you can see the decisions and thus payoffs of another pair of participants in the same game, i.e.
        of a
        random member of your own group and a member of the other group, with whom the member of your group was matched.
        After seeing the results of their game, you can transfer points from your endowment to decrease the income of
        the
        participants, whose decisions you’ve just seen. By transferring 1 point from your endowment
        you decrease the income of another
        participant by {{ Constants.punishment_factor }} points.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>You can not send more than {{ Constants.punishment_endowment }} points to both participants in total.</p>


    <p> Other members of both groups can make the same decisions about the participants, whose results they were shown.
        When you make your decision in Stage 2 and click ‘Next’, you will be shown your own and your partner’s decisions
        made in Stage 1 and your payoffs for this round.</p>
